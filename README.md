# Specification #1 Test:
"We want a React + Backend application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts. Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email, and phone number. All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email. The contacts will be persisted in the database."

# Development
`docker-compose up`

# Attention:
- List (/) data fields have been limited to id, firstname, lastname ... just for fun :) and having more interactions with the frontend.
- Delete acts as a soft-delete. Small behaviour choices taken accordingly.
